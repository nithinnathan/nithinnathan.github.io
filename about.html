        <h3>Overview:</h3>

            My narrative visualization structure is an "Interactive Slideshow".<br>
            To visually see other metrics, click the appropriate button located at the top middle of the screen.<br>

        <h3>Messaging:</h3>

            It is well known that India is still a developing country and for number of good reasons. Its large, diverse, was under British rule for close to 100 years, was under extreme poverty for decades. India has faced famines, major droughts, epidemics and natural calamities. But the country has overcome all these hindrences and showcased thier capabilities in Global platform. My narrative highlights how India's some major socio-economic factors are compared to the world.<br>
            My objective is to highlight some metrics that puts India at per with the rest of the world.

        <h3>Narrative Structure: Interactive Slideshow</h3>
        <p>
            You can follow the above buttons from left to right to follow the "steps" as it goes to the next pages. This is
            interactive slideshow because there are "drill-down" pages to narrow down some information.
        </p>

        <h3>Visual Structure:</h3>
        <p>
            Each scene (each socio-economic metric above) has a line graph, and the structure is consistent across the pages. You will be able to understand the data from the texts on X and Y axis, descriptions in the title, tooltips and annotations. It would be easy to stay  focused on the presented data on each scene.<br>
            The same buttons are present in each scene, that will help you navigate through this whole presentation, and will give you a seamless experince from the left to right without getting lost in information.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            As one could see from the line charts, gun violence increased year over year up until 2017.<br>
            From the 1980s to the 2020s, there have been roughly 2686 total victims affected by gun violence.<br>
            Though it doesn't sound like much, it's approximately 54 people per year who are affected by individuals who own guns.<br>
            The victims affected will need to adjust for the rest of their lives due to other people's decisions.<br>
            The only way for things to change is for there to be increased and better regulation of guns so that more people can live their lives to the fullest extent possible.<br>

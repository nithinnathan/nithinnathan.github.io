        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            The United States is the home of the highest rate of gun ownership worldwide due to the freedom to bear arms.<br>
            Although there are several harmless effects of firearms, there are many harmful ones as well, such as gun violence.<br>
            In this narrative visualization you will be able to explore statistics that demonstrate the violence caused by individuals who own a firearm in America and how that violence has increased over several decades.<br>

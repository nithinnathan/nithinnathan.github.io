        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            The United States is the home of the highest rate of gun ownership worldwide due to safeguarding by the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.<br>
            Individuals with firearms find usage through various activities, such as self-defense, hunting, and target shooting.<br>
            Although there are several harmless use cases for firearms, there are many harmful ones as well.<br>
            In this narrative visualization you will be able to explore some other statistics that demonstrate the violence caused by individuals who own a firearm in America.<br>

        <h3>Abstract:</h3>
        <p>
            The United States is the home of the highest rate of gun ownership worldwide due to safeguarding by the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.<br>
            Individuals with firearms find usage through various activities, such as self-defense, hunting, and target shooting.<br>
            Although there are several harmless use cases for firearms, there are many harmful ones as well, and in this narrative visualization you will be able to<br>
            explore some other statistics that demonstrate the violence caused by individuals who own a firearm in America.<br>
        </p>

        <h3>Visualization Structure:</h3>
        <p>
            My narrative visualization follows the structure of an "Interactive Slideshow".<br>
            To visually see other statistics, click one of the buttons located above.<br>
            You, the user, will be allowed to explore the slides presented.<br>
            In order to gain additional detail, you may hover over the line charts on each slide and see a little tooltip popup displayed underneath the chart.
            The overall theme is consistent across all slides of the visualization in order to help with understanding.<br>
        </p>

        <h3>Technical Details:</h3>

        <h4>1. Scenes</h4>
        <p>
            All scenes in this slideshow follow the same template for visual consistency.<br>
            Each scene is separated from one another through differentiated webpages.<br>
            The scenes contain line charts and other text that will help the user understand a trend over time.<br>
        </p>

        <h4>2. Annotations</h4>
        <p>
            The annotations in this narrative visualization also follow a theme to help with visual consistency.<br>
            The annotations used show points of emphasis in that trend that will require the user's attention.<br>
            Additionally, the annotations in this visualization do appear part of the scene and do not require any mouseover events.<br>
        </p>

        <h4>3. Parameters</h4>
        <p>
            The parameters in this narrative visualization are the buttons above.<br>
            By selecting a different button, the user will be taken to different slides in the slideshow.<br>
            The starting point for this visualization is this current page, the "About" slide.
        </p>

        <h4>4. Triggers</h4>
        <p>
            The triggers in this narrative visualization connect any actions or changes made to the parameters to affect the overall state of the visualization.<br>
            Specifically, they are the buttons presented above that take you to a different slide when clicked.<br>
            Additionally, there are tooltips that can be seen when you hover over the chart on each page.<br>
        </p>

        <h4>5. Libraries</h4>
        <p>
            The only libraries allowed for this assignment were the "d3", "d3-annotation", and "topoJSON Client".<br>
            No other libraries were allowed.<br>
            Inspiration for this visualization was taken from across the web.<br>
